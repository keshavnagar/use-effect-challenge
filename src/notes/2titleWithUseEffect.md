# title 
1. so we just access the title with js property
2. and assign the count to it or any thing if we pass the mixture of count and string than we'll pass to it
3. here the title is not the part of react here like pure funciton doesn't have any name of title we just access it from the js property, that's why we use the use effect, becuase use effect handle the external things
4. for thing we create another use effect for this side efffect
